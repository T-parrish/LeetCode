Sorting algorithms typically take O(NlogN) time to perform, this may not always be the appropriate search tool.\n",

Since there is no way to know beforehand if the target codon is early in the sequence, (without searching), binary search still seems to be the best possible solution for larger gene sequences, especially if we are looking for a rare codon buried deep within the gene sequence.\n",

    "The cost function g(n) evaluates the cost to get to a particular state. For this particular example, that would be the number of steps that the agent has moved through in order to reach the current state. The Heuristic function h(n) gives an estimate of the cost to reach the goal from the current state. If h(n) is an admissable heuristic, which means that it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal, then the final path will be optimal. On a two dimensional plane, (this maze), a straight-line heuristic can be considered an admissable heuristic since a straight line is the shortest distance between two points.\n",

    "A* uses something called a 'priority queue' as its foundational data structure. A priority queue maintains its elements in an internal order such that popping returns the highest priority element (lowest f(n)) at all times. To achieve this, the priority queue uses a binary heap which results in O(lg n) push time and O(lg n) pop time. Python's standard library includes heappush and heappop functions, which we will use to create a PriorityQueue data structure."
